# Tech Trends Analysis: Most Starred GitHub Projects & Most Active Hacker News Articles

## Overview
This project demonstrates various data analysis skills by working with multiple datasets and APIs. The project focuses on analyzing popular GitHub repositories, Hacker News articles, and data from different programming languages. The analysis includes data extraction, manipulation, visualization, and automation. The goal is to provide valuable insights into trends in software development, popular repositories, and articles, while showcasing key competencies required for a data analyst role.

## Skills Demonstrated
Data Analysis: Extracted and processed real-world data using APIs. Cleaned and structured data for analysis.

Data Visualization: Created dynamic and interactive visualizations using Plotly to convey insights.

API Integration: Demonstrated proficiency in making API requests, handling responses, and processing JSON data.

Automation: Implemented automated tests to validate data extraction and ensure correctness using Pytest.

## Key Features
### GitHub Repository Analysis:

Analyzes the most-starred Python repositories and compares them with non-Python repositories.

Extracts and processes data from the GitHub API.

Visualizes results using interactive bar charts, highlighting popular repositories by programming language and stars.

### Hacker News Article Analysis:

Retrieves and ranks top articles from Hacker News by comment count.

Visualizes the most-discussed articles using interactive plots.

API Data Extraction and Automation:

Demonstrates proficiency in working with APIs, making automated calls, and processing JSON responses.

## Technologies Used
Python: Primary language for data processing and visualization.

Plotly: For interactive data visualizations.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Requests: For making API calls and extracting data.

Pytest: For unit testing.

## Future Improvements
Real-Time Data Updates: Integrating real-time data feeds from GitHub and Hacker News to provide up-to-date information.

Dashboard Creation: Developing a web-based dashboard to make the analysis more accessible to non-technical users.

Advanced Analysis: Expanding the scope to include time-series analysis and machine learning models for predictive insights.
